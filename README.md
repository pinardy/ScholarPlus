The extensive amount of academic materials provided by the academic search engine when performing a search query leads to an information overload for researchers, thus leading to inefficiency for researchers as they need to navigate through a large amount of irrelevant material to find information that is relevant to them. As such, there is a need to increase the efficiency of researchers by enabling them to dynamically determine the visibility of information provided by academic search engines, so that they will only see information that is relevant to their research.

Our solution, ScholarPlus, proposes to allow users to dynamically change the levels of visibility of the result page to cater to the users' needs during the research process.
